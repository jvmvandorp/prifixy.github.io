# My site.

This is the main directory of my site, as a repository. I host it using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I got the domain for cheap at [Xel](https://xel.nl), however I can only change the nameservers on my domain so I don't recommend it. I got the SSL certificate, CDN, DDoS protection and DNS records at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

You can visit my website on [jaapvd.nl](https://jaapvd.nl).
